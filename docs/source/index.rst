Python meteorological post-processing system
============================================

The python meteorological post-processing system could be used to post-process
meteorological data. The main purpose of this project is the post-processing of
numerical weather forecast data. This package has some modules to load and
process meteorological spatial and time series data. More modules to process and
plot the data are planned.
